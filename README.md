# Scraping-with-scarpy

The present project intention is to build a spider able to extract data from craigslist.<br />
It is focused to extract ads from cars and trucks on sale in the eastside of seattle.<br />
The spider provides from the first layer:<br />
-Title<br />
-Price<br />
-Neighborhood<br />
-Direct URL to specific vehicle.<br />
Second layer scraping:<br />
-Obtains the description of the vehicle you get once clicking on a specific ad.<br />

You can find on the repository the spider as well as a generated csv obtained as a result of this project.
